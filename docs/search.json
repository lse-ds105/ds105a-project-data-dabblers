    "text": "Introduction\nThe initial analysis corroborated what we knew about the GME event, with visualisations clearly delineating the saga and linking stock fluctuations to real-time events effectively.\nOur next goal was to dive deeper into the phenomenon of how a dispersed group mobilised for change. Based on prior literature, we aimed to understand how they engaged in ‘connective action’ (Bennet, 2012), where the subreddit engages in collective action emerging from the use of digital media. Importantly, this refers to (i) decentralised and personalised participation, (ii) where a narrative is pursued against the establishment. We believe the incident meets these criteria.\nThis analysis, new to us, sought to identify trends and themes that explained the ‘why’ and ‘how’ of their collective action, without a predetermined path for investigation."

    "text": "Word Cloud Analysis\nWord clouds offered an immediate visualisation of key terms, guiding our deeper investigation towards more substantive and actionable insights.\n  \n\nJanuary Word Cloud\nJanuary: The term “buy” stands out prominently, along with “stock” and “GME,” signalling a strong buying sentiment and interest in GME stock. This suggests an alignment with the initial surge in GME’s share price, indicating a period of heightened investor enthusiasm.\n\n\nFebruary Word Cloud\nFebruary: Words like “hold” and “now” emerge as dominant, reflecting ongoing interest in GME. This seems to support the narrative of investors holding onto their shares amidst market fluctuations, showcasing a collective resolve.\n\n\nMarch Word Cloud\nMarch: “Price” and “share” continue to be significant, complemented by the appearance of “million” and “sell.” This shift might denote discussions around profit-taking or evaluating the stock’s worth following its earlier rally, pointing to a more cautious or strategic approach by the community.\nThese insights are analogous to those speculated throughout our interactive timeline.\n\n\nIssues\nWhile word clouds provide an intuitive and visually appealing way to explore textual data, their reliance on the frequency of individual words can lead to oversimplification, especially with complex topics like the GME saga. This method overlooks the context in which words are used together, missing crucial nuances and the relationships between terms. Therefore, we felt it necessary to augment these word clouds with more advanced text analysis tools to grasp the subtleties and deeper insights of such discussions."

    "section": "LDA Analysis",
    "text": "LDA Analysis\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a type of statistical model used for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a large volume of data.\nLDA is an unsupervised learning technique, which means it doesn’t require pre-labelled training data. This makes it suitable for exploratory data analysis where the themes or topics are not known a priori.\nHowever, the “topics” unearthed through LDA, being distributions of words, may not always encapsulate coherent or meaningful themes without careful interpretation. Also, LDA does not take into account the evolution of topics over time, which is relevant for this dynamic dataset.\nRegardless, the LDA visualisation offered intriguing insights, revealing underlying patterns and themes that were not immediately apparent.\n \n \nTerms like “moon,” “GME,” and “AMC” signal optimism towards rising stock prices, a perspective not captured in the word clouds. Similarly, “squeeze” and “hold” hint at trading strategy discussions, likely around short squeezes or maintaining positions through volatility.\n \nAdjusting the LDA model’s parameters, including the number of topics and iterations, enhanced our coherence score. In a refined analysis with five topics, the model’s output was as follows:\n\nTopic 1: Focused on actions related to stocks, particularly “buying” and “removing” with a strong focus on GME and AMC, indicating investment strategy discussions.\n\n\nTopic 4: Centred on the “short squeeze” narrative and optimism, with terms like “moon” and “squeeze” pointing to discussions on stock value surges.\n\n\nTopic 5: Related to trading timing, with advice on “buying dips” or “holding shares,” indicated by terms like “sell,” “tomorrow,” and “don’t stop”.\n\n \nUsing adjusted parameters, such as for three topics, the model’s output was as follows:\n\nTopic 1: Pertains to professional financial analysis, discussing company earnings, growth, and larger economic elements like policy impacts and sector advancements; e.g. “quarter,” “growth,” “sales,” and “earnings”.\n\n\nTopic 2: Reflects informal trading discussions on Reddit, intertwined with celebrity influence and cryptocurrency, emphasising buy/sell dynamics; e.g. “papa”, “musk”.\n\n\nTopic 3: Showcases individual financial narratives and community advice, marked by a blend of investment strategy talk and forum slang, such as “portfolio,” “money”, and “savings”.\n\n \n\nInsights\nLDA’s insights have been pivotal in unravelling the GME saga by showing how individual actors found common ground and formed a collective momentum, crucial aspects of connective action. The model revealed an alignment of interests and strategies, as terms like “moon,” “squeeze,” and “hold” reflect a shared optimism and a collective approach to trading.\nThe LDA model pinpointed key phrases like “moon,” “squeeze,” and “hold” as unifiers within the GME community, illustrating how these terms helped coordinate individual efforts into collective action. This analysis provided concrete insights into the group’s strategy, demonstrating the dynamics of connective action where digital platforms were used to align individual actions against market norms."

It revealed clusters of discussion around topics like “GME,” “squeeze,” and “hold,” which reflect facets of the community’s collective action. However, the true significance of these topics requires context that goes beyond their frequency and distribution.\n\n\nSentiment Analysis:\nOur sentiment analysis painted a narrative of rising and falling emotional tides within the GME dialogue. Peaks in sentiment seemed to walk hand-in-hand with stock price movements, but this visual waltz should not be mistaken for a causal relationship. Multiple unseen variables could be at play, and sentiment is but one actor on a crowded stage.\nUltimately, with the current insights, we can surmise interesting patterns and correlations across the data. Yet, we acknowledge that these are not definitive conclusions."
