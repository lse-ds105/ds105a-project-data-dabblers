### Challenges Faced

1. *Reddit API Limitations:* The inability to filter posts by date with the Reddit API hampers historical data collection.
2. *Pushshift API Access Restrictions:* Changes in the Pushshift API's terms of use restrict its availability for research, limiting access to historical subreddit data.
3. *Scraping Date-Specific Data:* The need to find alternative methods to bypass the Reddit API's date filtering limitations complicates data collection.
4. *Web Scraping Tool Limitations:* Using Selenium for scraping reveals a cap on data volume, with a maximum of 1000 recent posts being retrievable at a time.
5. *API Access Challenges:* Failed attempts to use another's Pushshift API access highlight the difficulties in obtaining necessary permissions for data access.
6. *Data Format Navigation:* Requesting a CSV version of Reddit API data points to the challenges of managing and utilizing the provided data formats efficiently.
