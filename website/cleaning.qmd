#### Challenges Faced

1. Formatting: Converting 'score' and 'num_comments' fields from their original format to integers for quantitative analysis presents a fundamental data type consistency challenge.

2. Alignment: Formatting the 'date' column to 'datetime64' to ensure compatibility and precise alignment with GameStop (GME) stock price data for time series analysis.

3. Aggregation: Using the groupby method to aggregate posts by date requires careful handling to ensure accurate summarisation of data points, like total posts, average scores, or comments per day.

4. Create Data Frame: The overall process of transforming raw subreddit data into a cleaned and structured data frame ready for analysis involves several preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardising data formats.

#### Challenges Faced

The overarching challenge of transforming the raw API data into a cleaned data frame involved multiple sub-tasks.

- Ensuring data consistency and accuracy after type conversion.
- Handling any missing or anomalous data points that could skew analysis.
- Structuring the data in a way that aligns with analytical goals, ensuring it's ready for analysis or visualisation.

## Merging Data Frames
Once the data was cleaned, the GME stock price data frame was merged with the r/wallstreetbets post data frame.
