### Challenges Faced

1. *Data Formatting:* Converting 'score' and 'num_comments' fields from their original format to integers for quantitative analysis presents a fundamental data type consistency challenge.

2. *Date Alignment:* Formatting the 'date' column to 'datetime64' to ensure compatibility and precise alignment with GameStop (GME) stock price data for time series analysis.

3. *Data Aggregation:* Using the groupby method to aggregate posts by date requires careful handling to ensure accurate summarization of data points, like total posts, average scores, or comments per day.

4. *Creating Dataframe:* The overall process of transforming raw subreddit data into a cleaned and structured dataframe ready for analysis involves several preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
