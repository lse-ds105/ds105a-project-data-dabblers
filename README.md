Webpage	Motivation	5	- The webpage explains what made the group curious about this data.

Our group became fascinated by the Gamestop short squeeze in January 2021 at the time of its occurrence. 

The subreddit r/wallstreetbet collectively short-squeezed Gamestop (GME) stock  fight hedge funds. 




Webpage	Data	5	- The webpage succinctly lists the data sources and the data collection challenges





Webpage	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	10	- The webpage paints a vivid picture of the data (things like: the number of data points, what are the different data types and the most relevant columns, summaries and distributions, etc.)





Webpage	Visualisation	10	- The plots look really nice
- All labels are clear and visible
- All variables are clearly identified.
- The plots and tables paint a vivid picture of what the data looks like.
- The group used ggplot (R) or plotnine (python) to generate the plots





Webpage	Storytelling	15	- The text is engaging and clear.
- There is no fluff
- The group described relevant technical steps without too many details.
- There was a nice conclusion.




Source code	Organisation	10	- The source code is available in a group's GitHub repository.
The code is replicable.
- There is a good structure of files and directories




Source code	Collaboration	5	- There is a list of everyone's contributions to the project somewhere in the project's webpage or README file.
- All members contributed with at least one commit to the group's GitHub repository.

Note: we do not expect all group members to do the same thing; each person could have a different contribution. For example, one person could focus more on data collection while another takes care of the visualisations, and the other member could focus more on documentation.






Source code	Data cleaning	20	- We see a good use of pandas (python) or tidyverse (R) to clean up data.
- Data types of the variables are consistent and make sense.
- Missing values were identified and dealt with.




Source code	Data wrangling	20	- We see evidence of good use of pandas and/or tidyverse to filter, merge, reshape and pivot your data as needed for the analysis/plots.
